# v2conversion

This repository will house the description, a gov proposal, and the proposed implementation. 


IONv2 is created by sending IONv1 to osmo1adfjlknvadufvndksvnkadfjnvdn (or so). The protocol then mints IONv2 and places that in the account holding the IONv2.  

Advantages over a clawback:

* Non-destructive
* Allows for future projects/ideas to leverage the IONv1 set as well as IONv2, perhaps porportionally
